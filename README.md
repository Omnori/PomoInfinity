## 📖 About

**Pomori** is a Chrome Extension designed to take the standard Pomodoro technique to the next level. Unlike traditional timers that track one session at a time, Pomori allows you to create a dynamic queue of specific work tasks, manage them individually, and visualize your progress with a clean, dark-mode interface.

Whether you are working alone or planning to scale for a team, Pomori helps you visualize time as a tangible resource.

## ✨ Features

* **Multi-Task Management:** Create and queue multiple timers for different tasks (e.g., "Coding", "Emails", "Design").
* **Dynamic Visuals:**
    * Main display shows the active timer with a dynamic conic-gradient border animation based on the remaining seconds.
    * Clean Dark Mode UI designed to reduce eye strain.
* **Customizable Durations:** Set specific hours, minutes, and seconds for every individual task.
* **Task Controls:** Play, pause, and delete individual tasks. The system automatically prioritizes active tasks.
* **Notification System:** Built-in in-app notifications for alerts, errors, and success states.
* **Persistent State:** Uses `chrome.storage` to ensure your data isn't lost when the popup closes.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Core:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Extension API:** Chrome Manifest V3
* **Styling:**
    * CSS Grid & Flexbox
    * CSS Variables for theming (`--col-background`, `--timeangle`)
    * Custom Fonts: *Arvo* and *Gorditas*
* **Data Persistence:** Chrome Storage API
